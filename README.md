a cool rust ray tracer

# TODO
- [ ] gamma correction
- [ ] Object transform
- [ ] Anti aliasing
- [ ] Handle Objs more robustly (accept non triangulated objs, handle normals better)
- [ ] Faster triangle intersection
- [ ] cosine weighted sampling
- [ ] Emissive surfaces
- [ ] Microfacet model BSDF rendering
- [ ] Completely smooth refraction + reflection
- [ ] Multithreaded
- [ ] Implement Surface Area Heuristic
- [ ] Use UnitVec3 for normals throughout code
  * IntersectionRecord
